  - some extra tests on main.py functions

0.13.14: 2017-02-12

  - optimisations on memory usage when loading YAML from large files (py3: -50%, py2: -85%)

0.13.0: 2016-11-20
  - if ``load()`` or ``load_all()`` is called with only a single argument
    (stream or string)
    a UnsafeLoaderWarning will be issued once. If appropriate you can surpress this
    warning by filtering it. Explicitly supplying the ``Loader=ruamel.yaml.Loader``
    argument, will also prevent it from being issued. You should however consider
    using ``safe_load()``, ``safe_load_all()`` if your YAML input does not use tags.
  - allow adding comments before and after keys (based on
    `StackOveflow Q&A <http://stackoverflow.com/a/40705671/1307905>`_  by
    `msinn <http://stackoverflow.com/users/7185467/msinn>`_)

  - allow dot char (and many others) in anchor name
    Fix issue 72 (reported by Shalon Wood)
  - Slightly smarter behaviour dumping strings when no style is
    specified. Single string scalars that start with single quotes
    or have newlines now are dumped double quoted: "'abc\nklm'" instead of::

      '''abc

        klm'''

0.12.14: 2016-09-21
 - preserve round-trip sequences that are mapping keys
   (prompted by stackoverflow question 39595807 from Nowox)

     (no specific tests, PR by Haraguroicha Hsu)

0.12.7: 2016-09-03
   - fixing issue 54 empty lines with spaces (reported by Alex Harvey)

0.12.6: 2016-09-03
   - fixing issue 46 empty lines between top-level keys were gobbled (but
     not between sequence elements, nor between keys in netsted mappings
     (reported by Alex Harvey)

0.12.5: 2016-08-20
  - fixing issue 45 preserving datetime formatting (submitted by altuin)
    Several formatting parameters are preserved with some normalisation:
  - preserve 'T', 't' is replaced by 'T', multiple spaces between date
    and time reduced to one.
  - optional space before timezone is removed
  - still using microseconds, but now rounded (.1234567 -> .123457)
  - Z/-5/+01:00 preserved

0.12.4: 2016-08-19
  - Fix for issue 44: missing preserve_quotes keyword argument (reported
    by M. Crusoe)

0.12.3: 2016-08-17
  - correct 'in' operation for merged CommentedMaps in round-trip mode
    (implementation inspired by J.Ngo, but original not working for merges)
  - iteration over round-trip loaded mappings, that contain merges. Also
    keys(), items(), values() (Py3/Py2) and iterkeys(), iteritems(),
    itervalues(), viewkeys(), viewitems(), viewvalues() (Py2)
  - reuse of anchor name now generates warning, not an error. Round-tripping such
    anchors works correctly. This inherited PyYAML issue was brought to attention
    by G. Coddut (and was long standing https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=515634)
    suppressing the warning::

        import warnings
        from ruamel.yaml.error import ReusedAnchorWarning
        warnings.simplefilter("ignore", ReusedAnchorWarning)

0.12.2: 2016-08-16

    by Leynos, bitbucket issue 38)
